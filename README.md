The practice involves designing an algorithm using the dynamic programming scheme to solve a coin change problem. A finite set of coins is available, and the objective is to pay a specific amount with the fewest number of coins possible.
For instance, given coins {1, 6, 10}, the goal is to return a change of value 12 using the minimum number of coins, resulting in the solution (6,6). The algorithm is invoked through a Java program that accepts arguments for various options,
such as tracing each step of the algorithm or displaying help. Input data is provided via a file, which includes the number of coin types, the values of available coins, and the amount to return.
The program output indicates the number of coins used and their values or flags if no solution exists. Implementation of the algorithm in Java is required, following an object-oriented design approach, 
with a focus on development efficiency and OO design principles.
